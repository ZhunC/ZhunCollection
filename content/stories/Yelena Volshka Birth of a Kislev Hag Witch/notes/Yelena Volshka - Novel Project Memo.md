## Core Concept

An existentialist salvation story set in a reimagined Kislev (Warhammer Fantasy), following an orphaned hag witch apprentice who loses everything in a Chaos invasion and must find her spiritual belonging to become the embodiment of Kislev's national spirit.

## Worldbuilding Foundation

### The Bear God Mythology

- After Ursun's death, the stalwart faith of Kislev people and their kinship to nature births a new deity: **the God of Bear and Homeland**
- All living beings in Kislev feel an instinctive divine call that death defending their homeland is the noblest mortal end
- Souls are collected by the Bear God and return to the "oneness of Kislev"
- **Central tension**: Animalistic desire for life vs. divine call of holy selflessness creates eternal dichotomy across all society

### Military-Social Structure

**Kislev's Defense Strategy**: Finnish-inspired model rather than Russian geographical depth

- **Three major cities**: Economic and population hubs
- **Rural areas**: Sacrificial buffer zones cultivated by farmer-soldiers
- **Core military unit**: **Kossars** (farmer-soldiers who purchase own weapons/armor, partially government-sponsored)

**Layered Defense System**:

1. **Border Kossars**: Purchase horses, flee initial invasion, become guerrilla scouts/light cavalry
    - Blessed by Bear God for bravery and wilderness relationship
    - Partner with bears/leopards, some learn beast magic and become druids/shapeshifters
    - Hunt, gather herbs, fish, work timber
2. **Interior Kossars**: Better access to armor/firearms, become heavy infantry
    - Farm closer to cities, more stable, serve as logistic hubs
3. **Hag Witch Glades**: Mini-kingdoms in deep forests, conduct attrition warfare
4. **Mobile Divisions**: Sledges, Streltsi, ice/storm mages, sledge-mounted Grom artillery
5. **Counter-attack Force**: Tzar Guards, Ice Guards, heavy cavalry (bear riders)

### Hag Witches

- View themselves as **embodiment and guardians of their glade** at birth
- Their fighters and beast-kin share this spiritual connection
- Operate as autonomous leaders during resistance campaigns
- Represent the deepest connection to the Bear God and Kislev's natural spirit

## Protagonist: Yelena Volshka

### Background

- **Orphan** raised to be a hag witch
- **Mentor and glade destroyed** in Chaos invasion
- **Companion**: Leo cub that fled with her, later dies
- **Current status**: Marginalized member of mage conclave where her beast magic and shapeshifting are dismissed as "rural mud-leg trickeries"

### Character Arc

**Act I**: Loss and displacement - everything with emotional attachment stripped away **Act II**: Spiritual crisis and alienation in the mage conclave **Act III**: Voluntary return to destroyed glade during final counter-attack **Climax**: Becomes the next hag witch atop the ruined, burnt wood

### Symbolic Role

- **Personal journey**: Existentialist salvation through finding spiritual belonging
- **National symbol**: Embodies Kislev's resilient spirit and authentic cultural identity
- **Thematic representation**: Resurrection of true Kislevite values over foreign magical traditions

## Literary Approach

- **Genre**: Existentialist fantasy in the tradition of Russian realism
- **Themes**:
    - Spiritual belonging vs. alienation
    - Authentic cultural identity vs. foreign influence
    - Individual salvation through embracing collective destiny
    - Death and rebirth (personal and national)
- **Tone**: Contemplative, melancholic, ultimately redemptive
- **Style**: Rich psychological interiority combined with vivid natural/magical imagery

## Story Structure Notes

- **Opening**: Yelena's life before the invasion (establish what she loses)
- **Inciting incident**: Chaos invasion destroys her glade and mentor
- **Rising action**: Journey with leo cub, its death, joining the mage conclave
- **Midpoint**: Recognition of her alienation and the dismissal of her true talents
- **Climax**: Return to the glade during counter-attack
- **Resolution**: Spiritual transformation into the new hag witch
