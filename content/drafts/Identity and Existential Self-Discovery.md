Q: Recently i'm having a small identity crisis. previously coming out of college, im proud that i have a deeper understanding to work and human energy through a long time mental struggle. now im finding out that many professionals share similar mentality and it creates a feeling of not being special.

this feels like im teying yo use my personality to assert my existence and my individual existence. it stems from the fear and thrown-inness of being.

i want myself to feel the futileness of that mental effort. there may very well be hundres of thousands of people in the world that has similar mentality, that dedicate their life and time to similar effort as me. after all those are the people i learn from.

meanwhile i have the feeling that those who are able to maintain this lifestyle--a lifelong of studying and self challenging and reinventing myself--may be what truly distinguish me and others. but by thinking so i again fall into the pithole of trhing to assert myself


A: What you're describing touches on something deeply human - that jarring moment when we discover our hard-won insights aren't as unique as we thought. It can feel like losing a piece of your identity when you realize that your carefully cultivated perspective is shared by many others.

The cycle you're caught in makes sense: you want to let go of the need to be special, but then you notice that even the ability to maintain a life of continuous growth might be distinguishing, which pulls you right back into the comparison trap. It's almost like trying not to think about a white elephant.

There's something worth sitting with in what you said about learning from people who share your mentality. Those hundreds of thousands of people you mentioned - they're not diminishing your experience, they're proof that what you've discovered about work and human energy has real value. The fact that others have walked similar paths doesn't make your journey less meaningful; it makes you part of something larger.

Maybe the "futileness" you're seeking to feel isn't about your efforts being pointless, but about releasing the need for those efforts to make you special. The work itself - the studying, challenging yourself, reinventing - can exist without needing to serve as proof of your uniqueness. It can just be what you do because it's valuable, because it matters to you, because it connects you to others doing similar work.

The thrown-ness you mention suggests you're familiar with existentialist thinking. There's something liberating in accepting that we're all thrown into existence without choosing it, all grappling with similar fundamental questions about meaning and identity. Your struggle with wanting to be special while knowing it's futile is itself a very human thing to wrestle with.
