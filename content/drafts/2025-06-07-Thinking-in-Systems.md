# Systems Thinking and Physical Systems Analysis

## Introduction

When we vaguely bundle a set of variables to another set of variables in our mind and develop interests in their interaction, we're creating the definition of a system. For example, if relationship and emotion can be quantified, the interaction between two people is a system. Thinking in systems is a paradigm or pattern of thinking coming up frequently in various walks of life, and this note is intended for the subject of approaching them. How to understand them. How to model them. How to simulate them. Specifically we're looking at systems more relevant to my profession: physical systems, like a toaster, a car, or a robot.

## An Out-of-Box Review

Why do we adopt the system paradigm? What is needed to apply this paradigm? What this paradigm involves?

- observing
- modelling
- controlling

## 1. Simplicity

**Is systems thinking the simplest way to solve complex problems to a desirable quality?**

Systems thinking provides a structured approach to understanding complexity by breaking down intricate relationships into manageable components and their interactions. While not always the simplest method for trivial problems, it becomes essential when dealing with:

- Multi-variable interactions (like robot kinematics)
- Feedback loops (thermal control systems)
- Emergent behaviors (traffic flow patterns)

**Complexity justification:** The overhead of systems modeling is justified when problems involve more than 3-4 interconnected variables or when failure to consider system-wide effects could lead to significant consequences. For a simple light switch, systems thinking is overkill. For autonomous vehicle navigation, it's indispensable.

**Alternative approaches:** Direct analytical solutions work for linear, single-variable problems. Heuristic approaches can suffice for well-understood domains. However, these alternatives fail when dealing with non-linear interactions and emergent properties that characterize most real-world physical systems.

## 3. Technicality

**What is systems thinking in physical domains?**

A methodology that views physical entities as interconnected networks of components, each with defined inputs, outputs, and transfer functions. The system's overall behavior emerges from these interactions rather than from isolated component properties.

**Core components:**

- **Elements:** Individual components (sensors, actuators, structural parts)
- **Interconnections:** Physical and information pathways between elements
- **Purpose:** The system's intended function or objective
- **Boundaries:** What's included/excluded from analysis

**How it works:**

The process involves three primary activities:

**Observing:** Data collection through sensors, measurements, and behavioral analysis. This includes identifying patterns, relationships, and system responses to various inputs.

**Modelling:** Creating mathematical representations that capture essential system dynamics. Common approaches include:

- State-space models for dynamic systems
- Transfer functions for linear systems
- Bond graphs for energy-based modeling
- Finite element models for structural analysis

**Controlling:** Implementing feedback mechanisms to achieve desired system behavior through:

- Open-loop control (feedforward)
- Closed-loop control (feedback)
- Adaptive control for changing conditions

**Underlying assumptions:**

- System behavior is predictable given sufficient model fidelity
- Components can be characterized by input-output relationships
- Interactions between components follow physical laws
- System properties can be understood through decomposition and synthesis

**Limitations:**

- **Model complexity:** Real systems may require prohibitively complex models
- **Computational constraints:** Simulation time may exceed real-time requirements
- **Uncertainty:** Measurement noise, parameter variations, and unmodeled dynamics
- **Non-linearities:** Many systems exhibit behavior that's difficult to model linearly
- **Scale effects:** Microscale phenomena may not scale predictably to macroscale behavior

**Improvement and extension strategies:**

- **Hierarchical modeling:** Multi-scale approaches from component to system level
- **Machine learning integration:** Data-driven models to complement physics-based approaches → [[ML-Enhanced System Modeling|ML-Enhanced System Modeling]]
- **Robust design:** Accounting for uncertainties and parameter variations → [[Robust Control Design|Robust Control Design]]
- **Co-simulation:** Coupling multiple specialized modeling tools → [[Multi-Domain Simulation|Multi-Domain Simulation]]
- **Digital twins:** Real-time model updating based on sensor feedback → [[Digital Twin Implementation|Digital Twin Implementation]]

**Advanced extensions:**

- **Multi-physics modeling:** Coupling thermal, mechanical, electrical, and fluid domains
- **Stochastic modeling:** Incorporating probability distributions for uncertain parameters
- **Optimization integration:** Simultaneous design and control optimization
- **Real-time adaptation:** Systems that modify their models based on operating experience
