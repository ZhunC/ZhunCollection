# InTAR-Inter-Task-Auto-Reconfigurable-Accelerator

## Core Idea
Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) produce **highly uneven data sizes** between tasks.  
- **Sequential accelerators** → efficient compute reuse, but require frequent off-chip memory access when intermediates don’t fit on-chip.  
- **Dataflow/pipeline accelerators** → avoid memory transfers by streaming, but suffer from idle units when production/consumption rates don’t match.  

**InTAR** proposes a new FPGA architecture that can **switch execution style at the task level**:
- **Sequential mode:** when data fits on-chip, avoid stalls.  
- **Pipeline / parallel mode:** when data is too large, stream it directly and avoid off-chip memory.  

Switching is near-instant (≈10–20 ns), guided by a **static schedule** precomputed at design time.

## Why It’s Better
- **Reduces wasted memory use** vs sequential.  
- **Reduces idle compute** vs dataflow.  
- **Small reconfiguration overhead** (few cycles).  
- **Resource-light:** only includes logic and interconnects needed for the model.  
- **Measured gains:**  
  - ~7× faster than sequential accelerators.  
  - ~1.8× faster than dataflow accelerators.  
  - Up to ~39× faster than some prior FPGA accelerators.  
  - 1.7–7× more power-efficient than GPUs (in tests on GPT-2).

## Key Terms
- **Task:** a matrix multiply, convolution, or similar operator inside a larger NN submodule (e.g., a step in attention or FFN).  
- **Static schedule:** predefined plan of which tasks run sequentially vs pipelined, based on memory limits.  
- **Reconfigurable PE Array:** core compute units reused across tasks, switched via lightweight control logic.

## Challenges
### Mentioned by authors
- Floorplanning on multi-die FPGAs (cross-die wires are limited).  
- Aligning memory banking across tasks to avoid timing bottlenecks.  
- Manual insertion of reconfiguration logic in HLS (not fully automated).  
- Current scheduling is heuristic, not optimal.

### Likely in practice (not emphasized in paper)
- Debugging correctness/performance with task-level switching.  
- Extending to highly dynamic models (e.g., mixture-of-experts).  
- Compilation overhead for very large models.  
- Integration challenges with host I/O and system-level bottlenecks.  
- Model-specific bitstreams reduce flexibility vs GPUs.

## Takeaways for Experimentation
- The novelty is in **choosing the right mode per task** based on intermediate data size vs memory capacity.  
- A simplified version can be tested on smaller FPGAs by:  
  - Defining tasks as 2–3 stage compute blocks (e.g., GEMM → activation → GEMM).  
  - Providing two execution schedules (sequential vs pipelined).  
  - Switching based on whether intermediates fit in on-chip RAM.
