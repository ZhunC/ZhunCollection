A man boarded a light rail rolling into the city. Three stations later, a woman sat right opposite to him. The cabin had nobody but them. 

It was early morning and it was the connection cabin between two larger trolleys. Three seats per row; six in total. Should it be rush hours, this is too little space. Still, it was early morning, and it was a less than half filled train. The woman walked in and out of five selectable seats, picked the one exactly opposite to the man. 

It was a young man with medium-length slightly curled black straight hair. He seemed to be on the way to some sports, wearing a tight red t-shirt with college logo, and a black knee short with no decors whatsoever. He was not tall but had wide shoulders and a strong build.

"He had the loose-limbed posture of someone between sleep and destinationâ€”medium-length dark hair slightly mussed, his college athletics shirt wrinkled from the early hour

Before she took her seat, he was staring out of the window opposite to him. A tense right calf supports his body against the train; relaxed arm and chest leaning back on his seat; a face with average look with hues of sleepiness and upward curiosity.

Neither she was dressing for big events. A light blue blouse with a carnation dark pink loose pants.

3. an extra woman joins, a quick evaluation on the third party
4. an extra man joins, reevaluate
5. the groaning passenger misses his stop, a temporary union forms
6. the other man leaves
7. the first girl leaves
8. more close in observation to the remaining two
9. both leaves
