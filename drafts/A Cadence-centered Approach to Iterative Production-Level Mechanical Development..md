## 0. Prefacing Statement

This document outlines the full cycle of mechanical system development, and its iteration starting from when a functionality is requested to when a physical system is released, based on my personal learnings, experiences, and understanding. It is intended as a manual for personal and group projects alike. 



## 1. Process Outline and Cadence

### Development Cycle Overview

In the following outline, I attempt to summarize a desired development cycle for production-ready, consumer-safe mechanical systems. 

1. **Functionality Request**
2. **Conceptual Design & Feasibility Study**
3. **Technical Specification Definition**
4. **Detailed Design & CAD Modeling**
5. **Simulation & Static Analysis**
6. **Unit-Level Testing**
7. **Integration Testing**
8. **Peer Design Review**
9. **Prototype Fabrication & KPI Testing** 
10. **User Acceptance Testing**
11. **Release Review/Go-No-Go Decision**
12. **Post-Deployment Monitoring**

### Cadence Structure

- **New Feature Planning Cycle**: Steps 1–3 occur as fast as needed and possible  
- **New Feature Integration Request**: Step 3 communicates to step 4 every **3 weeks**  
- **Development & Testing Cycle**: Steps 4–9 occur in **weekly iterations**  
- **Deployment Cycle**: Steps 10–12 occur as needed based on release readiness and overall project timeline  
- **Feedback Loop**: Any issues discovered in steps 5–12 is fed back to step 3 (spec revision for architectural changes) or step 4, depending on if it is a design issue (goes to step 3) or an implementation issue (goes to step 4).  
- **Team Ownership**: Team functionality and title varies from place to place, and for generality all teams are categorized into the following four categories with some example titles marked out. These four categories will be used to identify whose major responsibility it is in each step:  
  - **Stakeholder Owners**: For example, Product Development, Market Research, etc.  
  - **Architecture Owners**: For example, R&D / Systems Engineering, etc.  
  - **Implementation Owners**: For example, Mechanical / Application Engineering, etc.  
  - **Quality Owners**: For example, Testing, Quality Assurance, etc.
