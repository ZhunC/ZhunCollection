Hello! I'm Zhun ('June' by pronounciation). And this space is where I store interesting stuff. For now, those include notes, projects, and some short stories. The construction of dynamic systems and the construction of human conscious are equally fascinating to me, and I do find much in common between my engineering profession and creative pastime. Hope you enjoy them! 

A bit more on profession, I'm currently a Controls System Co-op at SharkNinja. You can find my resume in the last page.
