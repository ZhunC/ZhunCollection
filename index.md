Hello! I'm Zhun ('June' by pronounciation). 

I want to write manuals and tutorials, not just following them. And this site is where I try to do that.

Too much of education has been to following instructions, and too much of things done has gone poorly documented and hard to follow-up. 

To write manuals, to write steps, and to teach, is my response to it. Document my ideas, document how I develop those ideas, and develop steps to replicate them. That is my long time goal. That is the type of learning I want to keep doing forever. 

And this space is where I store such efforts. Some are more mature than others, but all reflect ongoing efforts from me. For now, those include notes, projects, and some short stories. The construction of dynamic systems and the construction of human conscious are equally fascinating to me, and I do find much in common between my engineering profession and creative pastime. Hope you enjoy them! 

A bit more on my profession, I'm currently a Controls System Co-op at SharkNinja. You can find my resume in the last page.
