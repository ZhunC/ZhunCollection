Zhun's Archive
---
Hello! I'm Zhun ('June' by pronounciation). 

I want to write manuals and tutorials, not just following them. And this site is where I document them.

Too much of education has been to following instructions, and too much of things done has gone poorly documented and hard to follow-up. 

To write manuals, to write steps, and to teach, is my response to it. Document my ideas, document how I develop those ideas, and develop steps to replicate them. That is my long time goal. That is the type of learning I want to keep doing forever. 

In my notes/manuals, I'm logging my newly acquired understandings, but also stressing on a few important aspects of the topics:

1. Simplicity. Is this method the simplest way to solve its target problem to a desirable quality? Is its complexity justified comparing to its solution quality?
2. Applicability. What foundation/preparation/pipeline is this method needed? Usually I will put this relation into backlinked posts.
3. Technicality. What is this model? How does it work? What is its underlying assumptions? What is its limitation? How do we improve and/or extend it? 

This is the outline I'm following now. Lots of contents to be filled, ideas to learn, introversion to think on. An exciting lifelong project, is what I'm building here. 

And this space is where I store such efforts. Some are more mature than others, but all reflect ongoing efforts from me. For now, those include notes, projects, and some short stories. The construction of dynamic systems and the construction of human consciousness are equally fascinating to me, and I do find much in common between my engineering profession and creative pastime. Hope you enjoy them!
